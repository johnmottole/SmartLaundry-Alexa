# SmartLaundry-Alexa

This is an Alexa Skill I'm currently working on that is to be used with an iOS app that I'm writing. It allows the user to use their iOS device as a sensor that they would place on their washer or dryer and detect when the washer or dryer is done. Once the laundry cycle is done it would update this in a Firebase database. The user could ask Alexa if their laundry is done and the Alexa skill, which is linked to the iOS app through Facebook authentication, would tell them the status.
